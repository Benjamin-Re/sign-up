Preview: https://benjamin-re.github.io/sign-up/

This project is about creating a sign up form and styling it with some advanced Css.
The form is frontend only. 
The page consists of four main sections:
- An image spanning the whole left taking up 25% of the page width. A logo could be displayed on top of the image. Mention creator of image!*
- The right side of the page divides into three sections top to bottom, each one taking
up about the same amount of space:
    - Descriptive text
    - the form (caption, first name, last name, email, phone, password, confirm password)
    - Button "Create Account" and below smaller "Already have an account? <a> sign in</a>
- The page should use an external font (@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Gideon+Roman&display=swap');)
